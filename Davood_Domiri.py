# Abstract:
# Authors: Davood Domiri and Shabek Jahni pIton!

# This paper presents an analysis of a satirical model for economic policy making,
# which has been developed as a Python script to provide humorous commentary on Iranian politics.
# This model, named the "Economic Policy Maker," generates a series of economic policies and incorporates a crooked election.
# Economic Policy Maker class generates random policies such as "print more Rials,"
# "increase taxes on Persian carpets," and "nationalize the pomegranate industry," among others.
# The model also includes an Election class, which selects a random candidate aligned with a Nezam policy.
# This policy, in turn, is one of the  policies generated by Economic Policy Maker.
# Furthermore, the model incorporates a feedback function that either reinforces policies that do not work
# or does nothing in response to the failure of these policies.
# This satirical representation of policy-making highlights the sometimes counterintuitive
# and self-defeating nature of real-world policies and decision-making processes.
# The primary aim of this study is to examine the use of humor and satire in the context of political commentary
# By generating absurd economic policies and incorporating a crooked election mechanism,
# This model, while primarily intended for amusement, also serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking
# and skepticism in analyzing and understanding political processes.
